# Introduction

The Multi-View Environment is an effort to ease the work with multi-view
datasets and to support the development of algorithms based on multiple
views. It features Structure from Motion, Multi-View Stereo and Surface
Reconstruction. MVE is developed at the TU Darmstadt. Visit the following
website for more details.

This README covers compilation and basic information about the
pipeline. For documentation, please refer to the Wiki pages on GitHub.

# Building MVE and UMVE

To download and build MVE, type:

    $ git clone https://github.com/simonfuhrmann/mve.git
    $ cd mve
    $ make -j8

To compile and run UMVE, the Qt user interface, type:

    $ cd apps/umve/
    $ qmake && make -j8
    $ ./umve

System requirements to compile and run MVE or UVME are:

 * libjpeg (for MVE, http://www.ijg.org/)
 * libpng (for MVE, http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
 * libtiff (for MVE, http://www.libtiff.org/)
 * OpenGL (for libogl in MVE and UMVE)
 * Qt 5 (for UMVE, http://www.qt.io)

Windows and OS X: Please refer to the Wiki pages for instructions.


# The Reconstruction Pipeline

The MVE reconstruction pipeline is composed of the following components:

 * Creating a dataset, by converting input photos into the MVE File Format.
 * Structure from Motion, which reconstructs the camera parameters.
 * Multi-View Stereo, which reconstructs dense depth maps for each photo.
 * Surface Reconstruction, which reconstructs a surface mesh.

The reconstruction tools can be found under `mve/apps/`. Please refer to the
[MVE Users Guide](https://github.com/simonfuhrmann/mve/wiki/MVE-Users-Guide)
for a more detailed description how to use these tools. Note that UMVE is
merely an interface for scene inspection and does not support reconstuction.
